There are many great Music Player apps availbale , however, I didn't find one that really suit the needs of a person who don't use that much tech in their day to day life like elderly person and that became the reason for creation of this app.


Of course,my app does not have everything and  since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people who have inspired me for working towards this app!

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.
